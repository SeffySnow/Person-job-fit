## Person-job-fit using outlier

This project aims to identify the best applicant for a specific job by leveraging an innovative approach. 
Instead of simply matching candidates to the job requirements, we utilize an outlier detection method to find the most outstanding individual.
Initially, a model is trained to classify applicants based on their resumes, determining their eligibility based on historical data. Following this, 
the Isolation Forest algorithm is applied to detect outliers, labeling the most exceptional candidate as the perfect applicant.
